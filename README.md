# Contact Database Application

## Overview

The Contact Database application is a web-based solution for managing contact information. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete contact details. This document outlines the setup, deployment, and usage of the application on Azure.

## Architecture

The application is built using [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc) (or replace with your technology stack) and uses an [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) for storage. It is hosted on an [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (for development)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) (for deployment)

## Deployment

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone 

### Step 2: Deploy to Azure

1. Navigate to the directory containing the ARM template (`azuredeploy.json`).

2. Deploy the resources to Azure using the Azure CLI:

az group create --name ContactDbResourceGroup --location eastus az deployment group create --resource-group ContactDbResourceGroup --template-file azuredeploy.json

Replace `ContactDbResourceGroup` and `eastus` with your desired resource group name and Azure region, respectively.

### Step 3: Configure the Application

After deployment, configure the application to use the Azure SQL Database by setting the connection string in the application settings of the Azure App Service.

## Usage

Describe how to use the application, including any available features and how users can access them.
